|  0 | A Distributed Diffusion Kalman Filter In Multitask Networks                                            | https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.03181 | https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.03181 | The Distributed Diffusion Kalman Filter (DDKF) algorithm in all its magnitude has earned great attention lately and has shown an elaborate way to address the issue of distributed optimization over networks. Estimation and tracking of a single state vector collectively by nodes have been the point of focus. In reality, however, there are several multi-task-oriented issues where the optimal state vector for each node may not be the same. Its objective is to know many related tasks simultaneously, rather than the typical single-task problems. This work considers sensor networks for distributed multi-task tracking in which individual nodes communicate with its immediate nodes. A diffusion-based distributed multi-task tracking algorithm is developed. This is done by implementing an unsupervised adaptive clustering process, which aids nodes in forming clusters and collaborating on tasks. For distributed target tracking, an adaptive clustering approach, which gives agents the ability to identify and select through adaptive adjustments of combination weights nodes who to collaborate with and who not to in order to estimate the common state vector. This gave rise to an effective level of cooperation for improving state vector estimation accuracy, especially in cases where a cluster's background experience is unknown. To demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithm, computer simulations were conducted. Comparison has been carried out for the Diffusion Kalman Filter multitask with respect to the Adapt then combine (ATC) diffusion schemes utilizing both static and adaptive combination weights. Results showed that the ATC diffusion schemes algorithm has great performance with the adaptive combiners as compared to static combiners. |

|  1 | Study of a structure preserving finite volume scheme for a nonlocal cross-diffusion system             | https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.01928 | https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.01928 | In this paper we analyse a finite volume scheme for a nonlocal version of the Shigesada-Kawazaki-Teramoto (SKT) cross-diffusion system. We prove the existence of solutions to the scheme, derive qualitative properties of the solutions and prove its convergence. The proofs rely on a discrete entropy-dissipation inequality, discrete compactness arguments, and on the novel adaptation of the so-called duality method at the discrete level. Finally, thanks to numerical experiments, we investigate the influence of the nonlocality in the system: on convergence properties of the scheme, as an approximation of the local system and on the development of diffusive instabilities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

|  2 | Tuning Spectral Properties of Individual and Multiple Quantum Emitters in Noisy Environments           | https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.02770 | https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.02770 | A quantum emitter in a dynamic environment may have its energy levels drift uncontrollably in time with the fluctuating bath. This can result in an emission/absorption spectrum that is spread over a broad range of frequencies and presents a challenging hurdle for various applications. We consider a quantum emitter in an environment that alters the energy levels so that the emission frequency is represented by a Gaussian random distribution around a given mean value with given standard deviation and correlation time. We study the emission spectrum of this system when it is placed under the influence of a periodic sequence of finite width $π$ pulses. We show that this external field protocol can effectively overcome spectral diffusion in this system by refocusing the bulk of the emission spectrum onto the pulse carrier frequency. We further consider two such emitters in different noisy environments and find that the two-photon interference operation can be made efficient by the sequence of finite width pulses applied on both systems. Finally, we show that an ensemble of nominally similar emitters, each with its different environment, and thus randomly shifted emission frequency, can have its overall emission spectrum that would otherwise be inhomogeneously broadened according to the random distribution, refocused onto a lineshape with a well-defined central peak that has the linewidth of an individual isolated non-noisy emitter. These results demonstrate for this specific model of noisy environments, the protection of spectral properties by an external control protocol here represented by a periodic sequence of finite width pulses.                                                                                          |

|  3 | No self-shadowing instability in 2D radiation-hydrodynamical models of irradiated protoplanetary disks | https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.05106 | https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.05106 | Theoretical models of protoplanetary disks including stellar irradiation often show a spontaneous amplification of scale height perturbations, produced by the enhanced absorption of starlight in enlarged regions. In turn, such regions cast shadows on adjacent zones that consequently cool down and shrink, eventually leading to an alternating pattern of overheated and shadowed regions. Previous investigations have proposed this to be a real self-sustained process, the so-called self-shadowing or thermal wave instability, which could naturally form frequently observed disk structures such as rings and gaps, and even potentially enhance the formation of planetesimals. All of these, however, have assumed in one way or another vertical hydrostatic equilibrium and instantaneous radiative diffusion throughout the disk. In this work we present the first study of the stability of accretion disks to self-shadowing that relaxes these assumptions, relying instead on radiation-hydrodynamical simulations. We first construct hydrostatic disk configurations by means of an iterative procedure and show that the formation of a pattern of enlarged and shadowed regions is a direct consequence of assuming instantaneous radiative diffusion. We then let these solutions evolve in time, which leads to a fast damping of the initial shadowing features in layers close to the disk surface. These thermally relaxed layers grow towards the midplane until all temperature extrema in the radial direction are erased in the entire disk. Our results suggest that radiative cooling and gas advection at the disk surface prevent a self-shadowing instability from forming, by damping temperature perturbations before these reach lower, optically thick regions.    |

|  4 | Global well-posedness for a rescaled Boussinesq system in critical Fourier-Besov spaces                | https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.05884 | https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.05884 | In this work we prove a global well-posedness result for a tridimensional rescaled Boussinesq system, with positive full viscosity and diffusivity parameters in the framework of critical Fourier-Besov spaces. This rescaled approach permits to know the behaviour of the system according to relations between both the parameters and the initial velocity and temperature; for instance, it is possible to consider, for small enough viscosity and large diffusivity, a large enough critical Fourier-Besov norm for the initial temperature and it is also possible to consider, for small enough diffusivity and large viscosity, a large enough critical Fourier-Besov norm for both the velocity and the temperature.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

|  5 | Rough homogenization for Langevin dynamics on fluctuating Helfrich surfaces                            | https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.06395 | https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.06395 | In this paper, we study different scaling rough path limit regimes in space and time for the Langevin dynamics on a quasi-planar fluctuating Helfrich surfaces. The convergence results of the processes were already proven in the work by Duncan, Elliott, Pavliotis and Stuart (2015). We extend this work by proving the convergence of the Itô and Stratonovich rough path lift. For the rough path limit, there appears, typically, an area correction term to the Itô iterated integrals, and in certain regimes to the Stratonovich iterated integrals. This yields additional information on the homogenization limit and enables to conclude on homogenization results for diffusions driven by the Brownian motion on the membrane using the continuity of the Itô-Lyons map in rough paths topology.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

|  6 | Patched patterns and emergence of chaotic interfaces in arrays of nonlocally coupled excitable systems | https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.06227 | https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.06227 | We disclose a new class of patterns, called patched patterns, in arrays of non-locally coupled excitable units with attractive and repulsive interactions. Self-organization process involves formation of two types of patches, majority and minority ones, characterized by uniform average spiking frequencies. Patched patterns may be temporally periodic, quasiperiodic or chaotic, whereby chaotic patterns may further develop interfaces comprised of units with average frequencies in between those of majority and minority patches. Using chaos and bifurcation theory, we demonstrate that chaos typically emerges via a torus breakup and identify the secondary bifurcation that gives rise to chaotic interfaces. It is shown that the maximal Lyapunov exponent of chaotic patched patterns does not decay, but rather converges to a finite value with system size. Patched patterns with a smaller wavenumber may exhibit diffusive motion of chaotic interfaces, similar to that of the incoherent part of chimeras.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

|  7 | Bond-based peridynamics, a survey prospecting nonlocal theories of fluid-dynamics                      | https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.06194 | https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.06194 | Peridynamic (PD) theories have gained widespread diffusion among various research areas, due to the ability of modeling discontinuities formation and evolution in materials. Bond-Based Peridynamics (BB-PD), notwithstanding some modeling limitations, is widely employed in numerical simulations, due to its easy implementation combined with physical intuitiveness and stability. In the present paper, several aspects of bond-based peridynamic models have been reviewed and investigated. A detailed description of peridynamics theory, applications and numerical models has been presented. Employed BB-PD integral kernels have been displayed, together with their differences and commonalities; then, some consequences of their mathematical structure have been discussed. The kinematic role of nonlocality, the relation between kernel structure and material impenetrability, and the role of PD kernel nonlinearity in cracks formation prediction have been critically analyzed and commented. Finally the idea of extending BB-PD to fluids is proposed and presented in the framework of fading memory material, drawing some perspectives for a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of the peridynamics in fluids.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

|  8 | Thermal diffusion of ionic species in charged nanochannels                                             | https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.06018 | https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.06018 | Thermally induced diffusion of ions (known as thermal diffusion) in charged nanochannels is of interest in various fields of engineering including energy recovery and desalination. This paper presents an investigation of thermal diffusion of sodium chloride in charged silica nanochannels, focusing on the effects of nanoconfinement and surface charges on the sign and magnitude of the Soret coefficient. The investigation is performed by molecular dynamics (MD). It is found that sign and magnitude of the Soret coefficient are controlled by the structural modifications of the interfacial solutions, including the ionic solvation and hydrogen bond structure that are induced by the nanoconfinement and surface charges. The results show that both nanoconfinement and surface charges can make the solutions more thermophilic. The thermal diffusion of solutions in boundary layers is significantly different from that of solutions in bulk fluid, contributing to the overall difference between the thermal diffusivity of pore fluid and that associated with bulk fluid. The findings provide further understanding of thermal diffusion in nano porous systems and the proposed MD simulation methodology is applicable to a wider category of coupled heat and mass transfer problems in nano-scale spaces.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

|  9 | Functional law of large numbers and central limit theorem for slow-fast McKean-Vlasov equations        | https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.05949 | https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.05949 | In this paper, we study the asymptotic behavior of a fully-coupled slow-fast McKean-Vlasov stochastic system. Using the non-linear Poisson equation on Wasserstein space, we first establish the strong convergence in the averaging principle of the functional law of large numbers type. In particular, the diffusion coefficient of the slow process can depend on the distribution of the fast motion. Then we consider the stochastic fluctuations of the original system around its average, and prove that the normalized difference will converge weakly to a linear McKean-Vlasov Ornstein-Uhlenbeck type process, which can be viewed as a functional central limit theorem. Extra drift and diffusion coefficients involving the expectation are characterized explicitly. Furthermore, the optimal rates of the convergence are also obtained.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
